* Implementation Plan
  1. [X] Make *voting* work (without permissions, user setting, admin
     config, etc.)
  2. [ ] Release an initial drupal package and prepare a test/demo
     site.
  3. [ ] Add *admin config*, *user settings*, *permissions*,
     permission checking, etc.
  4. [ ] Make a basic *integration with facebook* (for voting).
  5. [ ] Put it online.
  6. [ ] Add a basic *email interface* (for voting).
  7. [ ] Add a *mobile interface* (or theme).
  8. [ ] Build the pages for admin dashboard, reports and stats.
  9. [ ] Integrate with projects and packages from l10n_server
  10. [ ] Add an API for external applications.
  11. [ ] Integration with google+, twitter, diaspora, etc.
  12. [ ] Android app that can be used for voting.

* Tasks

** DB

*** DONE Make ID of projects guid (because they can be used in user prefs)
*** In the table of strings, add a reference to the previous (deprecated) string.

** UI

*** List of *string-->translations*
    + Define and implement suitable access rights.
    + Some of the advanced filtering options should be available
      only if the user has propper access rights.
    + Some editing options should be available only if the user has
      propper access rights.
    + For each suggestion, the admin (or moderators) should be able to apply
      additional actions (for example remove the suggestion).

    + For each l10n string, display in which projects it occurs
      (related locations), etc.
    + For each l10n string, display also the corresponding translations
      (best suggestions) in auxiliary (helper) languages. For example,
      besides the original l10n string (in English), the French and German
      translations may be displayed as well, if these are selected on
      the display options of the filter.

    + For each suggestion, add a Like (or +1) button. When it is clicked,
      the vote is submitted through an AJAX call. The voted (or liked,
      or +1'd) suggestion should be visibly distinguished from the rest.
    + For each suggestion, display details like: suggested by, suggested
      when, number of votes, some of the latest voters (and all the voters
      when clicked).
    + For each suggestion add a Flag (or -1) button. A suggestion is flagged
      when it is totally irrelevant to the string, or is spam, or is abusive, etc.
      In general, when a suggestion is flagged, it is something that should be
      removed. When flagging a suggestion, a reason/explanation may be given as
      well. When a suggestion is flagged, it has to be reviwed and removed
      by an admin/moderator. The admin may also take some action on the user that
      submitted the offending suggestion (or on the user that submitted the flag,
      if the suggestion is ok).

    + Voting mode can be 'single' or 'multiple', and it can be selected by admin
      (during installation). On mode 'single' at most one vote per string is allowed.
      On mode 'multiple' at most one vote for translation is allowed (user can
      approve more than one translation for the same string).
    + For the 'multiple' mode, an Unlike button should be available as well (in order
      to change the voting at any time).
    + When the votes are changed, the old (removed) votes should be stored on
      an archive table, in order to keep the history of changing votes as well.


*** TODO XML-RPC interface
    Or some other web-service (API) interface.

** Misc
   - Start with simple tests (l10n_feedback.test)
   - Improve instalation.
   - Make an initial package.
*** Add in l10n-sq.org a page for each project which can be liked, +1-d, etc.
*** DONE Convert to PO and import the translation files of Firefox, Mozilla, Thunderbird, etc.
*** DONE Import LibreOffice.
*** DONE Add origin on the search filter.
*** DONE Show related projects.
*** Add export_tgz as a drush command.
*** DONE Export in format diff/ediff.
*** DONE Use short url on the emails sent by cron.
*** Send full html pages by email.
*** Use GoogleTranslate API to make an initial suggestion for strings with no translation.
    It has become commercial. Cannot be done.
*** Improve the look of number of votes.


* Notes

** How to create TAGS for Emacs

   find . -type f | etags -
   find . -type f \( -name "*.module" -o -name "*.install" -o -name "*.inc" \) | etags -a --language=php -

   See: http://drupal.org/node/59868

** Fine-Tuning MySQL Full-Text Search

   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-fine-tuning.html
   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html

   We want to index even short words and to disable stopword filtering.

   1. Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf and set:

      [mysqld]
      ft_min_word_len = 1
      ft_stopword_file = ''

      [isamchk]
      ft_min_word_len = 1
      ft_stopword_file = ''

   2. Restart the server: service mysql restart
   3. Drop and recreate fulltext indexes.

** How to use simple REST API to get diffs

*** Get a list of diffs:
    wget -q --no-check-certificate -O list.txt https://test.l10n-sq.org/translations/project/diff/Mozilla/browser/sq ; cat list.txt
    wget -q --no-check-certificate -O list.txt https://test.l10n-sq.org/translations/project/diff/LibreOffice/sw/sq ; cat list.txt

    It is not stored yet in the DB (it will be stored if we get
    another snapshot).

** Misc

   + Field sguid:char(40) on strings, locations and translations must
     be of the same character set, otherwise mysql will not use the
     index (primary key) on queries. The same for the field tguid.

   + Crontab entry:
     0 4 * * *  wget -O - -q -t 1 --no-check-certificate https://test.l10n-sq.org/cron.php?cron_key=YVVQ7X8AmcbpDYEF_NGXISgbC-5z7_pOvxpjYEm2B_M
