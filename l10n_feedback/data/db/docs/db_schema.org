* DB Schema

  Files, Templates, Locations and Projects are related to the
  import/export of the PO files.

  Projects and Categories can be used to limit the scope of the
  search (and other operations).

  A project contains the translations of a certain application
  (software). A project can have several template (POT) files. A
  template file can have several PO files (one for each different
  language). Each of these PO files has many PO entries, which are
  stored in the table Locations.

  The table Locations stores only the comments, line references,
  flags, previous strings, etc. of each PO entry.

  The msgid (and msgctxt) of the entry is stored on the table
  Strings. A string can be connected to several locations, since the
  same string can be used on different projects.

  Each string can have several translations (or suggestions) in each
  language. Each translation can have many votes. Each vote is given
  by a certain user.

  The DB tables and their fields:

  + Files :: A PO file that is imported and can be exported from the
	     DB.
    - fid : serial :: Auto-increment internal identifier.
    - filename : varchar(250) :: The path and filename of the
	 imported PO file.
    - hash : char(40) :: The SHA1() hash of the whole file content.
    - potid : int :: Reference to the template (POT) for which this
	 PO file is a translation.
    - lng : varchar(10) :: The code of the translation language.
    - headers : text :: Headers of the imported PO file, as a long
	 line. Needed mainly for exporting.
    - comments : text :: Translator comments of the file (above the
	 header entry). Needed mainly for exporting.
    - uid : int :: Id of the user that imported the file.
    - time : datetime :: The date and time that the record was
	 registered.

  + Templates :: POT files that are imported.
    - potid : serial :: Auto-increment internal identifier.
    - tplname : varchar(50) :: The name of the POT template (to
	 distinguish it from the other templates of the same
	 project).
    - filename : varchar(250) :: The path and name of the imported
	 POT file.
    - pguid : char(40) :: Reference to the project to which this PO
	 template belongs.  it come from).
    - uid : int(11) :: Id of the user that registered the project.
    - time : datetime :: The date and time that the template was
	 imported.

  + Projects :: A project is the software/application which is
		translated by the PO files.
    - pguid : char(40) :: Project Globally Unique ID, pguid =
	 SHA1(CONCAT(origin,project))
    - project : varchar(100) :: Project name (with the release
	 appended if needed).
    - origin : varchar(100) :: The origin of the project (where does
	 it come from).
    - uid : int(11) :: Id of the user that registered the project.
    - time : datetime :: The date and time that the project was
	 registered.

  + Locations :: Locations (lines) where a l10n string is found.
    - lid : serial :: Internal numeric identifier of a line.
    - sguid : char(40) :: Reference to the id of the l10n string
	 contained in this line.
    - potid : int :: Reference to the id of the template (POT) that
	 contains this line.
    - translator_comments : varchar(500) :: Translator comments in
	 the PO entry (starting with "# ").
    - extracted_comments : varchar(500) :: Extracted comments in the
	 PO entry (starting with "#. ").
    - line_references : varchar(500) :: Line numbers where the sting
	 occurs (starting with "#: ").
    - flags : varchar(100) :: Flags of the PO entry (starting with
	 "#, ").
    - previous_msgctxt : varchar(500) :: Previous msgctxt in the PO
	 entry (starting with "#| msgctxt ").
    - previous_msgid : varchar(500) :: Previous msgid in the PO entry
	 (starting with "#| msgid ").
    - previous_msgid_plural : varchar(500) :: Previous msgid_plural
	 in the PO entry (starting with "#| msgid_plural ").

  + Strings :: Translatable strings that are extracted from projects.
    - string : text :: The string to be translated:
	 CONCAT(msgid,CHAR(0),msgid_plural)
    - context : varchar(500) :: The string context (msgctxt of the PO
	 entry).
    - sguid : char(40) :: Globally Unique ID of the string, as hash
	 of the string and context: SHA1(CONCAT(string,context))
    - uid : int :: ID of the user that inserted this string
	 on the DB.
    - time : datetime :: The time that this string was
	 entered on the DB.
    - count : int/tiny :: How often this string is encountered in
	 all the projects. Can be useful for any heuristics that try
	 to find out which strings should be translated first.
    - active : boolean :: The active/deleted status of the record.

  + Translations :: Translations/suggestions of the l10n strings.
	 For each string there can be translations for different
	 languages, and more than one translation for each language.
    - sguid : int :: Reference to the id of the l10n string that is
	 translated.
    - lng : varchar(5) :: Language code (en, fr, sq_AL, etc.)
    - translation : varchar(1000) :: The (suggested) translation of
	 the string.
    - tguid : char(40) :: Globally Unique ID of the translation,
	 defined as the hash: SHA1(CONCAT(translation,lng,sguid))
    - count : int/tiny :: Count of votes received so far. This can be
	 counted on the table Votes, but for convenience is stored
	 here as well.
    - uid : int :: id of the user that initially suggested/submitted
	 this translation
    - time : datetime :: Time that the translation was
	 entered into the database.
    - active : boolean :: The active or deleted status of the record.

  + Votes :: Votes for each translation/suggestion.
    - vid : serial :: Internal numeric identifier for a vote.
    - tguid : char(40) :: Reference to the id of the translation
	 which is voted.
    - uid : int :: Reference to the id of the user that submitted the
	 vote.
    - time : datetime :: Timestamp of the voting time.
    - active : boolean :: The active or deleted status of the record.

    - points : int :: Number of points rewarded for his activity.
    - config : varchar(250) :: Serialized configuration variables.

  + Snapshots :: Snapshots are tgz archives of project-lng
		 translation files.
    - pguid : char(40) :: Reference to the project.
    - lng : varchar(10) :: The language of translation.
    - snapshot : mediumblob :: The content of the tgz archive.
