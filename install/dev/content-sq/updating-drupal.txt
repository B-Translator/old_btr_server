First, backup the sites. Then give the following commands:

drush -l site1.com vset --yes maintenance_mode 0
drush -l site2.com vset --yes maintenance_mode 0
drush -l site1.com cache-clear all
drush -l site2.com cache-clear all
drush up
drush -l site1.com updb
drush -l site1.com up
drush -l site1.com vset --yes maintenance_mode 1
drush -l site2.com updb
drush -l site2.com up
drush -l site2.com vset --yes maintenance_mode 1

Finally restore the sites again.

------------------

I take a very lazy approach that is quite foolproof. Instead of making a patch I go the route of finding all changed files and replacing them, not replacing any files that were untouched. It leaves the /sites folder undisturbed among other things too.

1. Navigate to Drupal root
2. wget drupal-x.xx.tar.gz
3. tar -xzvf drupal-x.xx.tar.gz
4. cd drupal-x.xx
5. \cp -Rvupf * ../

The cp command with those flags does all that was said above. Flawless core upgrade every time.
