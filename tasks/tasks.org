* Tasks

** Integration with Facebook
*** For each translation review add a button for posting it on FB as a poll.
*** When a FB user votes or leaves a comment, update his status.


** Misc
*** TODO Rewrite import/export scripts as drush commands.
*** TODO Add API for import/export of PO files, for diffs, for terms, etc.
*** TODO Build an application with EmberJS and HTML5.
*** TODO Try to use Drupal7 entities for strings, translations, etc.
    This can improve the integration with the other Drupal modules.
*** TODO Publish/export incremental dumps of the database
    Maybe it should be a synch API which allows different instances of
    B-Translator to synchronize with each-other, according to the
    rules defined and agreed by the administrators.
*** Send out HTML notification emails.
*** Upgrade to Drupal8
*** Desktop application for submitting feedback.

*** POSTPONED Start with simple tests
    Status: Already started, but it needs some work to define
            more tests, and actually it is not so useful,
            or important, or urgent. Probably it can become
            more important when there will be more than one
            developers.
