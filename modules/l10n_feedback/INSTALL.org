* Installing pology
  About what is pology see:
  http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/l10n-support/pology/README?view=markup

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  aptitude install subversion
  cd /var/www
  svn checkout svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-support/pology
  #+END_EXAMPLE


* Getting PO Files
  PO files are kept on the directory ~/var/www/PO_files~
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  mkdir -p /var/www/PO_files/
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  However this can be customized on ~data/config.sh~. The variable
  /data_root/ can be an absolute path, or a single directory name.  If
  it is a directory name, then symbolic links pointing to it must be
  created on ~data/get/~ and ~data/import/~.


* Installing test data
  After installing the module, the tables of the DB should be filled
  with data. This is done by running the script ~data/install.sh~.


* Importing all the data
  Importing all the data can take a lot of time (many hours, maybe
  days), so it is a good idea to run the update script like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  nohup data/update.sh &
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  
  Then you can check the progress at any time by:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  tail -f nohup.out
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  But don't forget to check first ~data/config.sh~ and to make sure
  that the settings there are correct.
