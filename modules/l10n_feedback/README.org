* Interfaces (forms)

** Suggestion interface

   This is the form where the (authenticated) user is presented with
   an English string and several translation suggestions for it, and
   he votes the one that he thinks is the best, or provides another
   suggestion which he thinks is better.

   The string to be translated is selected randomly, unless the user
   has selected 'sequential' on his settings. The selection of the
   string is also done so that it complies with the restrictions
   imposed by the user on his settings (for example only from a
   certain project).

   The selection of the string should be also influenced by certain
   algoriths and heuristics, which should try to give more exposure
   to the strings that need more votes. For example if a string
   already got 10 votes and another one got just 2 votes, the second
   one should be more likely to be selected.

   This interface should be able to integrate somehow with facebook,
   email, google+, etc.


** Query interface

   On this form anybody (registered user or anonymous) can supply a
   string in English, and the system will return the translation
   suggestions related to it and the corresponding votes that each
   suggestion has.

   If the English string does not have an exact match on the DB, a
   list of similar strings will be returned and the user will choose
   to check one of them.

   This functionality of querying suggestions will be offered also by
   a web service so that it can be used by any external programs.


** User configuration interface

   Here the user customizes his settings, as described in the
   functional requirements.  Some of the things that he can customize
   are:
    - how many translation reviews per day (default one)
    - which communication means he preferes (email, facebook, google+,
      twitter, website, android app, iPhone app, etc.)
    - which projects or packages he would like to focus on (for
      example, if the user selects the package KDE, only strings that
      belong to a project on this package will be sent to him for
      review and feedback)
    - which languages he would like to use as primary and secondary
      source languages (for example a user that is not confident in
      English, may choose to use French as a primary language and
      Italian+Spanish as secondary/helper languages)
    - sequential or random selection of strings (random is the
      default, but if the user is interested in just one or a few
      projects, he may prefer to review the strings sequentially)


** Export and import interfaces

   Usually everybody can export PO files, but only the users with
   certain permissions can import.


** Admin interfaces

   The admin should be able to customize the overall behaviour of the
   module, to check activity, to get reports and statistics, to
   maintain the data (backup, restore, update) etc.


* Drupal paths

** translations[/<sguid>]

   This interface presents a string and its available translations to
   the user. The user will vote one of them as the best translation,
   or will provide a new translation that he thinks is better.

   <sguid> is the hash of the string that is being translated. If not
   given, then a random string will be selected.

   The original string is usually presented in English, but
   additional languages can be presented as well, if the user is not
   confident with English. (He can select these options on the user
   settings page as well.)


** translations/search?lng=..&limit=..&mode=..&words=..

   Displays a list of strings and the corresponding suggestions, which
   match some filter conditions. Filter conditions can be modified on
   the interface. Search can be done by the content of the strings and
   suggestions, and can be limited in scope by the project, by the author
   of suggestions, by the submition date, etc.

   From the displayed list, it is also possible to view details (for
   string or suggestion), to submit votes, etc.


** translations/project
   + translations/project/list ([/origin[/project[/format]]])
   + translations/project/export (/origin/project/language)
   + translations/project/export_tgz (/origin/project/language)
   + translations/project/diff (/origin/project/lng[/nr[/ediff]])
     Return the diff/ediff of the PO files for a given
     origin/project/lng/nr.  If the parameter 'nr' is '-', it returns
     the latest most-voted suggestions since the last snapshot.  If
     the parameter 'nr' is missing, it returns a list of the saved
     diffs instead.


** translations/user_settings
   The user can set:
   - translation language
   - the prefered source language(s)
   - how many reviews per day is willing to make
   - etc.


** translations/admin
   + translations/admin/config
   + translations/admin/dashboard
   + translations/admin/reports
   + translations/admin/stats
