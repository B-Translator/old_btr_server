Vocabularies are fake translation projects, in the sense that they are
not strings extracted from a program. Their strings are added
manually. They serve as a collection/dictionary of interesting,
important and frequently used terms and their suggested
translations. They can be useful for translators on their everyday job
and also can help to discuss and unify the terminology used across
different programs.
