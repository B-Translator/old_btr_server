These drush commands are used to import/export PO files and projects
into the database. The existing translations of the PO files will
create the initial bases for voting and adding further
suggestions. Then, the most voted translation will be exported.

There are two steps for importing a projects' translations.  The first
step is to import the POT (template) file of the project, and the
second step is to import the PO (translation) file for each language
that is supported.

POT files are imported by 'pot-import' (or 'impot'), which can be
called like this:
  drush [-l site] impot origin project file.pot
  drush -l l10n-sq.org impot KDE kturtle test/kturtle.pot
Instead of using the POT file itself, usually it is OK to use the PO
file of a language, like this:
  drush -l l10n-sq.org impot KDE kturtle test/kturtle_fr.pot
This is because this import does not use the translations at all.  It
just creates a new project (with the given origin and project name),
creates its locations, and creates the corresponding strings. If such
a project already exists, it is first removed (along with its related
locations).

PO files are imported by 'po-import' (or 'impo'), which can be called
like this:
  drush [-l site] impo origin project lng file.po
  drush -l l10n-sq.org impo KDE kturtle fr test/kturtle_fr.po
This command adds in DB only the files and translations of the
corresponding language. It assumes that the project and locations and
strings are already imported, otherwise it will fail and exit. So,
before using 'impo' for importing a translation file, make sure that
'impot' has been already called for the corresponding project.

For exporting files, the command 'po-export' (or 'expo') is used,
which can be called like this:
  drush [-l site] expo origin project lng [file.po]
  drush -l l10n-sq.org expo KDE kturtle fr test/kturtle_fr.po
If 'file.po' is missing, the content of the file is output to stdout.
After a file is exported, it should also be processed with 'msgmerge',
so that any entries that are skipped during import (like
translator-credits, etc.)  can be restored. For example:
  drush -l l10n-sq.org impo KDE kturtle sq kturtle_sq_orig.po
  drush -l l10n-sq.org expo KDE kturtle sq kturtle_sq_exported.po
  msgmerge -o kturtle_sq_merged.po kturtle_sq_exported.po kturtle_sq_orig.po
