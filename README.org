This is a Drupal installation profile for B-Translator Server.

* Installation

  The recommended way of installation for a production server is to
  install it inside a chroot, in /trusty/ (ubuntu 14.04). Assuming
  that we have already installed a minimal ubuntu server 14.04
  (trusty), btr_server can be installed in it like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  mkdir /var/chroot
  cd /var/chroot/
  git clone https://github.com/B-Translator/btr_client.git
  git clone https://github.com/B-Translator/btr_server.git
  cp btr_server/install/settings.sh btr.sh
  vim btr.sh
  nohup nice btr_server/install/chroot.sh btr.sh &
  tail -f nohup.out
  less -r nohup.out
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This will install in ~/var/chroot/~ a minimal ubuntu system,
  B-Translator Server, B-Translator Client, and everything that is
  needed for the normal work of the system. It will also make the
  neccessary common configurations of the system.

  The installation script will create as well the init script
  ~/etc/init.d/chroot-btr~, which can be used to start and stop the
  services inside the chroot:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  service chroot-btr start
  service chroot-btr stop
  #+END_EXAMPLE


* What is B-Translator

  The codename *B-Translator* can be decoded like *Bee Translator*,
  since it aims at collecting very small translation contributions
  from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into something
  useful.

  It can also be decoded like *Be Translator*, as an invitation to
  anybody to give his small contribution for translating programs or
  making their translations better.
