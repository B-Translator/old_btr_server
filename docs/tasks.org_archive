*** DONE Design DB schema
    Design a propper DB schema for l10n_suggestions. In general, it is
    going to be reacher than the open-tran.eu schema, since it is going
    to keep data about votes/evaluations/promotions of different
    suggestions.

*** DONE Get open-tran.eu data
    Download it from: http://open-tran.eu/dev.html

*** TODO Import data
    Write a script for importing the open-tran.eu data into the
    l10n_suggestions DB (MySQL). It should:
    1. [X] dump the data from the SQLite db
    2. [X] import them into MySQL
    3. [X] rearrange them to fit the new schema requirements
    4. [ ] take care of both an initial import and an update (in the
       case of update it should be carefull not to overwrite any
       existing data)

* TODO Write scripts for importing and updating data from *.po files

  + Take care to preserve the data that already exist in the DB.
  + Check the plurals (how they are handled?).
  + There are cases of strings where exaclty the same translation is
    stored several times. Try to fix it.
