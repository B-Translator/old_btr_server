* Tasks

** UI

*** List of *string-->translations*
    + Define and implement suitable access rights.
    + Some of the advanced filtering options should be available
      only if the user has propper access rights.
    + Some editing options should be available only if the user has
      propper access rights.
    + For each suggestion, the admin (or moderators) should be able to apply
      additional actions (for example remove the suggestion).

    + For each l10n string, display also the corresponding translations
      (best suggestions) in auxiliary (helper) languages. For example,
      besides the original l10n string (in English), the French and German
      translations may be displayed as well, if these are selected on
      the display options of the filter.

    + For each suggestion, add a Like (or +1) button. When it is clicked,
      the vote is submitted through an AJAX call. The voted (or liked,
      or +1'd) suggestion should be visibly distinguished from the rest.
    + For each suggestion, display details like: suggested by, suggested
      when, number of votes, some of the latest voters (and all the voters
      when clicked).
    + For each suggestion add a Flag (or -1) button. A suggestion is flagged
      when it is totally irrelevant to the string, or is spam, or is abusive, etc.
      In general, when a suggestion is flagged, it is something that should be
      removed. When flagging a suggestion, a reason/explanation may be given as
      well. When a suggestion is flagged, it has to be reviwed and removed
      by an admin/moderator. The admin may also take some action on the user that
      submitted the offending suggestion (or on the user that submitted the flag,
      if the suggestion is ok).

    + Voting mode can be 'single' or 'multiple', and it can be selected by admin
      (during installation). On mode 'single' at most one vote per string is allowed.
      On mode 'multiple' at most one vote for translation is allowed (user can
      approve more than one translation for the same string).
    + For the 'multiple' mode, an Unlike button should be available as well (in order
      to change the voting at any time).
    + When the votes are changed, the old (removed) votes should be stored on
      an archive table, in order to keep the history of changing votes as well.

** Workflow

*** When a new suggestion is added, notify previous voters to review their votes.

*** The author of a suggestion can withdraw it or change it.
    In both cases the votes are lost (deleted or archived) and the
    voters are notified about the change.


** API

   Build an API/web-service that totally separates the database from
   the interface. Everything should be done through the
   API/web-service.

*** XML-RPC interface
    Or some other web-service (API) interface.

*** Split the module l10n_feedback into server and client
    These two should communicate only through the API/web-service.

** Integration with Facebook
*** For each translation review add a button for posting it on FB as a poll.
*** When a FB user votes or leaves a comment, update his status.


** Misc

*** Start with simple tests (l10n_feedback.test)
*** Improve the look of number of votes.

*** TODO Install any module for sending email to all the users of l10n.org.al
    Try:
    - simplenews
    - mass_contact
*** TODO Invite all the existing users to customize their profile/settings.
*** TODO Install any module for sending invitations to other users.

*** TODO Try to use on l10n.org.al the theme sky or some other suitable theme.
    Try to configure a responsive layout (which changes automatically
    for different screen sizes).

*** TODO Create user dashboards/stats/reports.
    - http://drupal.org/project/homebox
    - http://drupal.org/project/user_dashboard
    - Create custom blocks.

*** TODO Admin dashboards/stats/reports.
    - http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/dashboard

*** TODO Import PO files of Drupal.
*** TODO Generate a POT file for B-Translator and import it.
*** TODO Import Wordpress translations into B-Translator.

*** TODO Try to improve the performance.

**** TODO Try NGINX:
     + http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/11/a-faster-web-server-ripping-out-apache-for-nginx/
     + http://blog.celogeek.com/201209/202/how-to-configure-nginx-php-fpm-drupal-7-0/

     + http://groups.drupal.org/node/238983
     + http://groups.drupal.org/nginx

*** Send out HTML notification emails.
    Replace one-time-login with one-time-submittion on the
    notification emails

*** Create custom blocks
    - Most active users and their stats.
    - Latest vote/suggestion activity (like a stream).
    - Personal latest activity.

*** Improve the website (homepage) of the project on GitHub.
*** Create a page on Google+ for l10n-sq and btranslator.
*** Add in l10n.org.al a page for each project which can be liked, +1-d, etc.

*** Separate the display interface from the database logic with a web-server API.

*** Upgrade the server on rackspace
    From 512MB RAM and 20GB HDD, to 1024MB RAM and 40GB HDD.
    Need to find some funds or sponsors, to support this.

*** Enable export again.
*** Apply mod_security on l10n.org.al
*** Generate code documentation by phpDocu and doxygen.
*** Use modules: views, pannels, views_slideshow, invite, etc.

*** Publish/export incremental dumps of the database
    Maybe it should be a synch API which allows different instances of
    B-Translator to synchronize with each-other, according to the
    rules defined and agreed by the administrators.

*** Context information about the strings
    - External link to google.com, which tries to get more details
      about the context in which a string is used.
    - External link to open-trans.eu
    - Other external links (related to the projects to which the
      string appears).

*** Publish Disqus comments to twitter account @l10n_sq
