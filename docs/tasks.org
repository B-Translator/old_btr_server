* Tasks

** UI

*** List of *string-->translations*
    + For each l10n string, display also the corresponding translations
      (best suggestions) in auxiliary (helper) languages. For example,
      besides the original l10n string (in English), the French and German
      translations may be displayed as well, if these are selected on
      the display options of the filter.

    + For each suggestion, add a Like (or +1) button. When it is clicked,
      the vote is submitted through an AJAX call. The voted (or liked,
      or +1'd) suggestion should be visibly distinguished from the rest.
    + For each suggestion add a Flag (or -1) button. A suggestion is flagged
      when it is totally irrelevant to the string, or is spam, or is abusive, etc.
      In general, when a suggestion is flagged, it is something that should be
      removed. When flagging a suggestion, a reason/explanation may be given as
      well. When a suggestion is flagged, it has to be reviwed and removed
      by an admin/moderator. The admin may also take some action on the user that
      submitted the offending suggestion (or on the user that submitted the flag,
      if the suggestion is ok).

    + Voting mode can be 'single' or 'multiple', and it can be selected by admin
      (during installation). On mode 'single' at most one vote per string is allowed.
      On mode 'multiple' at most one vote for translation is allowed (user can
      approve more than one translation for the same string).
    + For the 'multiple' mode, an Unlike button should be available as well (in order
      to change the voting at any time).

** Integration with Facebook
*** For each translation review add a button for posting it on FB as a poll.
*** When a FB user votes or leaves a comment, update his status.


** Misc

*** DONE Test and fix the installation of a new B-Translator server.
*** TODO Rewrite import/export scripts as drush commands.
*** TODO Add API for import/export of PO files, for diffs, for terms, etc.
*** TODO Export vocabulary in formats CSV, PDF, etc.
*** TODO Use the module MetaTags.
*** TODO Build an application with EmberJS and HTML5.
*** TODO Client module for Drupal
    Make btrClient a completely separate Drupal module, which can be
    installed on any drupal site.
*** TODO Try to use Drupal7 entities for strings, translations, etc.
    This can improve the integration with the other Drupal modules.

*** Add in l10n.org.al a page for each project which can be liked, +1-d, etc.
    Update: A content type for projects has been created, but more work
    needs to be done in order to make it usable.
*** Use modules: views, pannels, views_slideshow, etc.
    Try also: Organic Groups (for project pages), Display Suite,
    Entity View Attach, Entity Cache, Features, etc.

*** TODO Publish/export incremental dumps of the database
    Maybe it should be a synch API which allows different instances of
    B-Translator to synchronize with each-other, according to the
    rules defined and agreed by the administrators.

*** TODO Try to replace Disqus with something better (maybe LiveFyre).

*** Send out HTML notification emails.
    Replace one-time-login with one-time-submittion on the
    notification emails

*** Upgrade the server on rackspace
    From 512MB RAM and 20GB HDD, to 1024MB RAM and 40GB HDD.
    Need to find some funds or sponsors, to support this.

*** TODO POSTPONED Start with simple tests (l10n_feedback.test)
    Status: Already started, but it needs some work to define
            more tests, and actually it is not so useful,
            or important, or urgent. Probably it can become
            more important when there will be more than one
            developers.

*** Upgrade to Drupal8
*** Desktop application for submitting feedback.
*** Improve the look of number of votes.
*** Context information about the strings
    - Internal link to translations into other auxiliary languages.
    - External link to google.com, which tries to get more details
      about the context in which a string is used.
    - Other external links (related to the projects to which the
      string appears)
      + transvision.mozfr.org
    - Links to any related tearms from vocabulary.
