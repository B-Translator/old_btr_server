The scripts in this directory will be used to make the initial
import of the PO files in the database. All the PO files available
that we can find will be imported, creating so a big l10n dictionary
(like that of open-tran.eu). This dictionary will be the initial
base for voting and making further translation suggestions.

'po-import.php' is used to import a single PO file into the database.
It doesn't have the overhead of a drush command and is much faster.
It is going to be used for the initial import of the PO files (which
are going to be too many, hundreds or more, so it is important that
it works as fast as possible). It can be called like this:
  ./po-import.php projectname lngcode filename.po
  ./po-import.php kturtle sq kturtle.po

'settings.php' should be a link to the configuration file of the site.
It can also be a copy (modified or not). The script 'po-import.php'
includes it in order to get the parameters of the database connection.

'POParser.php' is the parser used. It is taken from:
http://code.google.com/p/php-po-parser/issues/detail?id=2
It makes no validity checks, but this is OK, since the PO files that
are imported are supposed to be valid. Anyway, if needed, PO files
can be checked with msgfmt before being parsed (and skipped if not
valid).
