Development Setup of B-Translator

[[http://info.btranslator.org][B-Translator]] helps to get feedback about /l10n/ (translations of the
programs). It tries to collect very small translation contributions
from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into something useful.
It is developed as a Drupal7 profile and the [[https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator][code]] is hosted on GitHub.
Here I describe the development setup and process that I use for this
project. Most of the the tips are project specific, however some of
them can be used on any Drupal project.

* Installation

  Installation for development is the same as the installation for a
  production server, inside a chroot. The steps are like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  mkdir /var/chroot
  cd /var/chroot/
  git clone https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator.git
  nohup nice B-Translator/install/install.sh btr &
  tail -f nohup.out
  chroot btr/ /tmp/install/config.sh
  chroot btr/ rm -rf /tmp/install
  reboot  ## it is advisable to reboot the host after this installation
  #+END_EXAMPLE


* Changing the webserver

  The webserver that is used for production is NGINX because it is
  more responsive in high load, has build in cache, etc. The
  configuration of NGINX is also tweaked for production (has DoS
  protection, short timeout, etc.) For development Apache2 can be more
  suitable. It can be started and stopped like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/dev/apache2.sh start
  /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/dev/apache2.sh stop
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  *Important:* When /apache2/ is started, the services /nginx/,
  /memcached/ and /php5-fpm/ are stopped. Don't forget to modify the
  init script ~/etc/init.d/chroot-btr~ like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #CHROOT_SERVICES="cron php5-fpm memcached mysql nginx"
  CHROOT_SERVICES="cron mysql apache2"
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  The script =apache2.sh= cannot make this modification automatically
  because it runs inside the chroot, and the init script is outside
  the chroot (on the host system). So it has to be done manually.

  I also add something like this on */etc/hosts*, so that I can access
  it on the browser with a domain name:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  127.0.0.1  l10n.org.xx dev.l10n.org.xx
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  This modification has to be done manually as well.


* Re-installing the application

  It can be done with the script =dev/install.sh=:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/dev/reinstall.sh
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  It will rebuild the Drupal directory with *drush make* and install
  the btranslator profile with *drush site-install*, and then do all
  the rest of configurations just like they are done during
  installation.

  Normally there is no need to reinstall the application, unless we
  want to test the installation profile and the installation scripts.

  Another kind of re-installation, which touches only the database of
  Drupal (btr) and nothing else, can be done with the script
  =dev/install.sh=:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/dev/reinstall-db.sh
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It is useful for testing the features. Usually, when features are
  un-installed, things are not undone properly. In order to leave out
  a feature, it should not be installed since the beginning. So, it is
  important to test different combinations of them to see which one
  works better for us.


* Making a clone for development

  Inside the chroot I make a clone for development like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  cd /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/
  dev/clone.sh dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It creates a new application with root */var/www/btr_dev/* and with
  DB named *btr_dev*. It also creates the drush alias *@dev*, and
  modifies the configuration of the webserver so that the cloned
  application can be accessed at *dev.l10n.org.xx*.

  *Caution:* The root directory and the DB of the clone will be
  erased, if they exist.

  Other clones like this can be created for testing etc. To cleanup
  (remove/erase) a clone, we can use *clone_rm.sh* like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  cd /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/
  dev/clone_rm.sh dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  By the way, we can also modify a little bit the configuration of a
  development copy of the application (in order to help us not confuse
  a development copy with a live or testing one), with the script =dev/config.php=:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  cd /var/www/
  drush @btr php-script btr/profiles/btranslator/config.php dev1
  drush @dev php-script btr/profiles/btranslator/config.php dev2
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It will set site_name to 'B-Translator (dev1)', will make site email
  something like 'user+dev1@gmail.com', will enable email re-routing,
  display the /devel/ menu on the footer region, etc. It is not
  required, but sometimes may be useful.

* Making a backup of the application

  Sometimes, when testing things on Drupal (installing/uninstalling
  modules etc.) things get messy and it is not possible anymore to
  revert to the state that you were before starting the test. In this
  case the only way to get safely to a previous stable state is by
  restoring a backup (or installing from the scratch and repeating all
  the configurations).

  A snapshot of the application is just like a full backup with a time
  stamp. It saves the state of the application at a certain time, both
  the code (the whole Drupal directory) and the database. It can be
  done like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chroot /var/chroot/btr/
  cd /var/www/
  ln -s btr_dev/profiles/btranslator/ B-Translator

  B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh make
  B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh make @dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  These will create the files ~snapshot-btr-20130602.tgz~
  and ~snapshot-btr_dev-20130602.tgz~. They can be restored
  like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore --file=snapshot-btr-20130602.tgz
  B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore --file=snapshot-btr_dev-20130602.tgz
  B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore @dev --file=snapshot-btr-20130602.tgz
  B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore @dev --file=snapshot-btr_dev-20130602.tgz
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  As you may notice, a snapshot of @dev can also be restored on the
  main application, and the other way around.

  However, in many cases a backup/restore of the database is all that
  is needed, and it is more efficient. It can be done with *drush
  sql-dump* and *drush sql-query* like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  drush sql-dump > btr.sql
  drush sql-dump @dev > btr_dev.sql

  drush sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btr.sql
  drush sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btr_dev.sql

  drush @dev sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btr.sql
  drush @dev sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btr_dev.sql
  #+END_EXAMPLE


* Accessing the code of the application from outside chroot

  In order to access easily the code of the application from outside
  chroot, I create a symbolic link like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  cd /var/chroot/
  ln -s btr/var/www/btr_dev/profiles/btranslator/ \
        dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Now I can go to */var/chroot/dev/* and start /emacs/ or any other
  tools. This way I don't have to install /emacs/ or any other
  development tools inside the /chroot/ and can use the best of
  development tools that my host environment can offer me.


* Pushing commits to github

  The copy of the application on
  =/var/www/btr_dev/profiles/btranslator/= (as well as the one
  on =/var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator/=) are actually clones
  of the git repository at https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator
  so we can *pull* from it and *push* to it. Pulling (to get
  up-to-date) can be done by everybody, however pushing requires a
  username and password (the ones that are used to access the account
  at GitHub).


* The commit workflow

  For small or straight-forward changes I can also work directly on
  the *master* branch, then *commit*, and then *push* to github.

  However I usually use a bit more complicated workflow. First I
  create and checkout a *dev* branch. When the work is done I merge
  this branch to *master* and then delete it. Finally *push* the
  commit(s) to github.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  git checkout -d dev     ### create a branch and switch to it
  [work-commit-work-comit]
  git checkout master     ### switch back to master
  git pull                ### get any latest commits from github
  git merge dev [--squash]
  git push                ### send commits to github
  git branch -D dev       ### erase the branch
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Usually there are no commits comming from github, since I am
  the only developper (unless I have worked and commited from some
  other location). So, when I merge without *--squash* this usually
  results in *fast-forward* merge, which means that all the
  commits that I have done on the branch *dev* are automatically
  transferred to the branch *master*.

  However sometimes there may be /dirty commits/ on the *dev* branch,
  which means that there may be incomplete commits, or commits that
  reverse what was done on the previous commits etc. When I wish to
  reorganize commits and make them cleaner, I use the *--squash*
  option, which collects all the changes on the *dev* branch and
  leaves them on the *master* sandbox as local modifications
  (uncommitted). Then I can redo the commits on a cleaner or more
  logical way. Afterwards the *dev* branch will be deleted and the old
  commits will be lost.


* Making a local git clone of the dev application

  Sometimes it is not easy or suitable to test modifications on the
  *@dev* application (~/var/www/btr_dev~). For example this is the
  case when I have to test install/uninstall, enable/disable modules,
  features, etc. In this case I test them on the main application
  instance (~/var/www/btr~). Since both applications are clones of the
  [[https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator][GitHub repository]], it is easy to push commits from /btr_dev/ to
  /github/ and to pull them from /github/ to /btr/.

  However, sometimes it is better to test modifications and make sure
  that they work, before pushing them to /github/. This can be done if
  the code on /btr/ is a git clone of the code on /btr_dev/ (instead
  of being a clone from /github/).

  The script =dev/git-clone-dev.sh= makes just this. It replaces the
  code of /btr/ with a git clone of the *dev branch* from
  /btr_dev/. Then the workflow is like this:
  1. Work and commit on the branch *dev* of *btr_dev*
  2. Pull on *btr* and test.
  3. Repeat steps *1* and *2* until the modification that we are
     making is OK.
  4. Push changes upwards to github, like this:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cd /var/www/btr_dev/profiles/btranslator
     git checkout master
     git merge dev [--squash]
     git push
     git branch -D dev
     git checkout -b dev
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     So, after merging to *master* and pushing to /github/, we delete
     the branch *dev* and create a new one.
  5. Make a git pull on *btr* and sync it with *btr_dev*
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cd /var/www/btr/profiles/btranslator
     git pull
     #+END_EXAMPLE


* Working with a dev-test-live workflow

  All the work that is described on the sections above is about
  development and local testing that is done on a working copy
  (sandbox) of a /chroot/ installation. This is usually installed on
  my personal machine (that I use for development).

  At some point, all the modifications have to be transferred to a
  public server, where the application is in "production", performing
  "live". On that public server there is the same /chroot/ environment
  as in the development server. The synchronization of the application
  can be done via git push and pull.

  However *drush rsync* and *drush sql-sync* offer another option for
  synchronization. For more details see:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  drush help rsync
  drush help sql-sync
  drush topic docs-aliases
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  These commands use drush *aliases*, which allow also remote
  execution of drush commands. On my development environment I have
  created the file ~/etc/drush/remote.aliases.drushrc.php~, which has
  a content like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <?php

  $aliases['live'] = array (
    'root' => '/var/www/btr',
    'uri' => 'http://l10n.org.al',

    'remote-host' => 'l10n.org.al',
    'remote-user' => 'root',
    'ssh-options' => '-p 2201 -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa',

    'path-aliases' => array (
      '%profile' => 'profiles/btranslator',
      '%data' => '/var/www/data',
      '%pofiles' => '/var/www/PO_files',
      '%exports' => '/var/www/exports',
      '%downloads' => '/var/www/downloads',
    ),

    'command-specific' => array (
      'sql-sync' => array (
	'simulate' => '1',
      ),
      'rsync' => array (
	'simulate' => '1',
      ),
    ),
  );

  $aliases['test'] = array (
    'parent' => '@live',
    'root' => '/var/www/btr',
    'uri' => 'http://www2.l10n.org.al',
    'remote-host' => 'www2.l10n.org.al',

    'command-specific' => array (
      'sql-sync' => array (
	'simulate' => '0',
      ),
      'rsync' => array (
	'simulate' => '0',
      ),
    ),
  );
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It defines the aliases *live* and *test*. The test/stage application
  is almost identical to the live/production one, however it is not
  for public use. The idea is to test there first any updates/upgrades
  of the application, in order to make sure that they don't break any
  things, before applying them to the real live application. In my case
  it is placed on a different server, however it can also be placed on
  the same server as the live application (just make a clone of the main
  application with =dev/clone.sh test=).

  When everything is set up correctly, the synchronization can be done
  as simply as this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  drush rsync @live @test
  drush sql-sync @live @test
  drush rsync @live @dev
  drush sql-sync @live @dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  *Note:* Synchronizing this way from *@test* to *@live* or from
  *@dev* to *@live*, usually is a HUGE mistake, but the /simulate/
  option on the config file will make sure that it fails.

  For drush commands to work remotely, *ssh* daemon has to be running
  on the remote server, inside the chroot environment. By default it
  is not installed, but it can be installed with the script
  *dev/install-sshd.sh*. This script will also take care to change the
  ssh port to *2201*, in order to avoid any conflicts with any
  existing daemon on the host environment, and also for increased
  security.

  For remote access to work correctly, the public/private key ssh
  access should be set up and configured as well. For more detailed
  instructions on how to do it see:
