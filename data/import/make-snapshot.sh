### Generate snapshots for a project that is imported.
### The first (initial) snapshot contains the original
### files that are imported, and it will not generate
### a diff. The second snapshot contains the export of
### the original files, and it will produce and store
### the first diff. This initial diff actually contains
### the differences that come as a result of formating
### changes between the original format and the exported
### format. It also contains the entries that are skipped
### during the import.
