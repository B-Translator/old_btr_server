After installing the module, the tables of the DB should be filled with
data. This is done by running the script 'import/db_install.sh'.
But don't forget to check first 'import/config.sh' and to make sure
that the settings are correct.

Importing all the data can take a lot of time (many hours), so it is
a good idea to run the install script like this:
  nohup import/db_install.sh &
Then you can check the progress at any time by: tail -f nohup.out
